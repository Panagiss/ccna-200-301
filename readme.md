# Cisco CCNA 200-301 Notes

These are personal notes I took and helped pass the CCNA exam. 
Feel free to use them in any way they help you.

These Notes were taken during studying **Neil Anderson's** course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/ccna-complete/) and so the few shapes and diagrams you will find in the notes are taken from Neil's course.

Also you can find his course for free in his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoL3y5BaIvw2heBYZd0MSUDsDtZRmbKJa)

All files come in multiple formats. After requests I have added *pdf* and *md* appart from *docx*. If you want any other formats or any other request, **ping** me. I have made an inbound allow ACL just for that ;)
