# Cisco CCNA 200-301 Notes

These are personal notes I took and helped me pass the CCNA exam. 
Feel free to use them in any way they help you.

These Notes were taken while studying **Neil Anderson's** course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/ccna-complete/) and therefore few shapes and diagrams you will see in the notes are taken from Neil's course.

Also you can find his course for free in his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoL3y5BaIvw2heBYZd0MSUDsDtZRmbKJa)

All files come in multiple formats. After requests I have added *pdf* and *md* formats apart from *docx*. If you have any other request, **ping** me. I have made an inbound allow ACL just for that ;)

## Take in mind
These notes follow Neil's course content. __BUT there maybe be few objectives not covered in depth and other ones not covered at all. For example 'TCP/IP', 'OSI layers' and the 'IOS operating system' are not covered!__. As you can see the notes start from 'IP Address classes'. 

So it's __adviced to take the course or any other official study material__ (other courses, books, [Neil's free YT playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoL3y5BaIvw2heBYZd0MSUDsDtZRmbKJa), etc) and use these notes as an extra help to understand/memorize and go back to look an refresh your memory. __You should not rely only on these notes for passing the exam.__ For example you should practice yourself for subnetting which is always asked in the exam.

## Subnetting

Subnetting is essential for passing the CCNA. I haven't put any resources about it, so I will provide some useful ones that I read. These helped me understand it as well as practice and eventually master the topic:

- Neil's free YT videos starting from [No 36](https://youtu.be/25JSoskhORM) on the playlist and finishing on [No 47](https://youtu.be/FQ7zQtMYkaM) for understanding subnetting
- [Practice subnetting](https://subnettingpractice.com/)
- Verify answers on the [online subnet calculator](https://www.subnet-calculator.com/)
