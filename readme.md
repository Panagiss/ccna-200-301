# Cisco CCNA 200-301 Notes

These are personal notes I took and helped pass the CCNA exam. 
Feel free to use them in any way they help you.

These Notes were taken during studying **Neil Anderson's** course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/ccna-complete/) and so the few shapes and diagrams you will find in the notes are taken from Neil's course.

Also you can find his course for free in his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoL3y5BaIvw2heBYZd0MSUDsDtZRmbKJa)

All files come in multiple formats. After requests I have added *pdf* and *md* formats apart from *docx*. If you any other request, **ping** me. I have made an inbound allow ACL just for that ;)

## Note
These notes follow Neil's course content. __**BUT** there maybe be few objectives not covered in depth and other ones not covered at all. For example 'TCP/IP', 'OSI layers' and the 'IOS operating system' are not covered!__. As you can see the notes start from 'IP Address classes'. 

So it's __adviced to take the course or any other official study material__ (other courses, books, etc) and use these notes as an extra help to understand/memorize and go back to look an refresh your memory. __You should not rely only on these notes for passing the exam.__ For example you should practice yourself for subnetting which is always asked in the exam.
